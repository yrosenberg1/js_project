# Technologies

* The data I used in my project comes from [Baseball Reference](https://www.baseball-reference.com/), converted into CSV's.
* MLB Stats uses vanilla JS, to select the data and to search by criteria.
* D3 is used to render the data into a visual chart that can be toggled by either by percentage or by ranking.

# Implementation

* Created a bar graph to allow users to visualize and better analyze playersâ€™ statistics using D3 to bind data to the DOM for efficient manipulation of the user interface (UI).
* Implemented multiple ways to look for a player, including a search bar with a dropdown allowing users to search for a specific player, players matching keywords, and by team.
* Tracked user selection of ranking vs. percentile in a top-level state variable, which can be toggled via an event handler resulting in alternate format of data presented, aided by animation styling to ensure smooth transitions.
