# Technologies

There are a plethora websites to gather data from. The ones I plan to use are primarily [Baseball Reference](https://www.baseball-reference.com/) and [Baseball Savant](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/) for gathering data. 

I will be using vanilla JS, to select the data and to search by criteria.
I will also need D3 to render the data in a visual chart.

# Implementation

Day 1-2: Render the chart format using D3.
Day 3: add the data, and connect it to the chart.
Day 4-5: add the selectors of player, season or team.
