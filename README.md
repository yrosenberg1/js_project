# Technologies

There are a plethora websites to gather data from. The ones I plan to use are primarily [Baseball Reference](https://www.baseball-reference.com/) and [Baseball Savant](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/) for gathering data. 

I will be using vanilla JS, to select the data and to search by criteria.
I will also need to use D3 to render the data in a visual chart.

# Implementation

* Days 1-2: Render the chart format for by percentile and by leage leaders using D3.
* Day 3: Add the data, and organize it by percentile and league rankings.
* Day 4: Add search function for by season, player name, team. Toggle graphs function for by percentile and by league rankings.  
* Day 5: Finish up, debug, finish styling.
